= Portfolio Optimizer (mlr3 + MLflow)

This project implements a modular portfolio optimization system in R using the `mlr3` ecosystem and integrated with `MLflow` for experiment tracking. It supports custom constraints, sector-specific bounds, and flexible optimization objectives.

== Features

- Portfolio optimization with `nloptr` and equality constraints
- Custom objective and constraint registry (YAML-configurable)
- `mlr3` pipeline integration for preprocessing + learner orchestration
- MLflow logging of parameters, metrics, and artifacts
- Evaluation of saved models (e.g., Information Ratio, Alpha)
- Quarto report generation with visualizations

```

== Getting Started

=== Install Dependencies
```r
install.packages(c("mlr3", "mlr3pipelines", "mlr3learners", "mlr3filters", "arrow", "data.table", "yaml", "mlflow", "ggplot2", "paradox", "R6"))
```

=== Run Pipeline
```r
source("R/pipeline_runner.R")
result <- run_pipeline()
```

== Configuring the Optimizer

Edit `data/optimizer_config.yaml`:

```yaml
optimizer:
  bounds:
    sector_tech: [0.0, 0.3]
    sector_industrial: [0.1, 0.5]
    sector_energy: [0.2, 0.6]
  objective: mean_error
  constraint: weights_sum_to_1
  algorithm: NLOPT_LD_SLSQP
  maxeval: 500
```

== Evaluating a Saved Model

```r
source("R/evaluator.R")
eval <- evaluate_saved_model()
print(eval$alpha)
print(eval$ir)
```

== Logging and MLflow

Artifacts such as weights and predictions are logged to MLflow:
```r
Sys.setenv(TRACKING_URI = "mlruns")
```

Register the model using the Python script:
```bash
python register_model.py $(cat output/latest_run_id.txt) output/weights.parquet
```

== Quarto Report

Open and knit `reports/portfolio_report.qmd` to generate full visual analytics of the run.

== Extending

- Add new objectives or constraints in `PortfolioOptimizer.R`
- Swap learners or add transformers via `OptimizerGraphLearner`
- Use `mlr3tuning` to tune bounds or other hyperparameters
